# AIP-040 Non-Fungible Token â€” Reference Implementation

This project can be used directly to deploy non-fungible tokens on Aion AVM, and we recommend to use the `NFToken` class as the starting point for every Aion Java contract which will incorporate/extend non-fungible functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. Supported operating systems are macOS, Linux and Windows
2. Install Java (version 11 or later) and Apache Maven
   - On macOS
     1. [Do not use](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28635465/300224) the official installer from Oracle, that approach is painful, nobody uses it
     2. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
     3. `brew cask install java`
     4. `brew install maven`

## Building and testing

Prepare your Maven project build state

```sh
./mvnw initialize
```

Build and test

```sh
./mvnw clean install
```

A build which passes all tests will be indicated by:

> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

at the bottom of your build.

After you have made any changes, run the build and test command above.

## Overview

* `AVMBlockchainWrapper` is a wrapper around the current AVM storage API.
* `AIP040Encoder` is an encoder for any contract to interrogate any AIP-040 contract, use this to make type safe method calls which it converts to ABI encoded, wire-ready bytecode.
* `AIP040Events` is an output encoder for any AIP-040 contract to emit events, use this to pass type safe calls which it directly logs to the blockchain.
* `NFToken{,Storage}` are a base class and storage details for implementing the standardized AIP-040 behavior.
* `NFTokenMock{,Encoder}` are a useful implementation and encoder which has additional functionality which we believe many people will want, but which is not standardized.
* `Main{,Encoder}` are a deployable contract and encoder to access it.

Notes:

* We expect the AVM storage API will change in the future, and the wrapper will be promoted upstream, obviating the need to include it in this project. https://github.com/aionnetwork/AVM/issues/399.

* The encoders are boilerplate code which should be generated from a Java `interface`. Java does not support class (not instance) methods with dynamic dispatch, so we cannot make an `interface` for Aion contracts. This is a shortcoming of Java and should be addressed as a [Java Specification Request](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/overview). Please help.

## Extending

If you extend the functionality of the token implementation, for example to add pausing, extend the provided implementation.

To incorporate non-fungible tokens into your contract, which may have other features, copy the AIP-040 boilerplate code from the provided `Main.java`.

## Maintenance

- Periodically update to the most recent version, to obtain the latest bug fixes and new features:

  ```sh
  mvn versions:use-latest-versions -Dincludes="org.checkerframework:*"
  ```

* Periodically update mvnw if necessary. We recognize upstream as https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper

* Periodically review AVM and other Maven dependencies and update if necessary:

  ```sh
  mvn aion4j:init -DforceCopy
  ```
