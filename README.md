# ATS-040 Non-Fungible Token â€” Reference Implementation

This project can be used directly to deploy non-fungible tokens on Aion AVM, and we recommend to use it as the starting point for Aion Java contracts which will incorporate/extend non-fungible functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. Supported operating systems are macOS, Linux and Windows
2. Install Java (version 11 or later) and Apache Maven
   - On macOS
     1. [Do not use](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28635465/300224) the official installer from Oracle, that approach is painful, nobody uses it
     2. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
     3. `brew cask install java`
     4. `brew install maven`

## Building and testing

Prepare your Maven project build state

```sh
./mvnw initialize
```

Build and test

```sh
./mvnw clean install verify
```

A build which passes all tests will be indicated by:

> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

at the bottom of your build.

After you have made any changes, run the build and test command above.

## Extending

TODO: add notes about Java subclassing/interfaces (with default implementations) and mixins
